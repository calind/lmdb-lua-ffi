lmdb-lua-ffi
============

LuaJIT FFI based bindings for lmdb (http://symas.com/mdb/). This library is work-in-progess and is far for being stable. The interface is inspired by [py-lmdb](http://lmdb.readthedocs.org/).

So far the environment and transaction implementation in almost complete. The cursors are WIP.
